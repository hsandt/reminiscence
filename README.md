# Reminiscence

A terminal adventure based on communication via gestures.

The game was entirely coded in Ruby on an Android smartphone, using [Termux](https://termux.com) with the ruby package, [CodeBoard Keyboard for Coding by GazLaws](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gazlaws.codeboard) and Vim.
